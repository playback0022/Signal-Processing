If the frequencies emitted by a contrabass are between 40Hz and 200Hz, then the highest frequency which can be emitted is 200Hz. The band-pass filter which is applied to the signal should therefore be [-BHz, BHz], where B=200. The Nyquist-Shannon theorem states that sampling rate fs must be at least twice as large as B, for any bandlimitted signal. In this case, fs must be at least 400Hz.
