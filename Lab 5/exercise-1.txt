a) Ts = 1h => fs = 1 / 1h
fs = 1 / 3600
fs = 0.0002(7)Hz

b) 18288 samples with Ts = 1h => 18288h
18288h / 24 = 762 days
762 / 365 ~= 2 years

c) No aliasing => signal x is band-limited, so -B(Hz) <= x(t) <= B(Hz)
Nyquist theorem => fs >= 2B
Optimal sampling => fs = 2B => B = fs / 2
Therefore, B = 0.00013(8) Hz

e) DC offset (np.mean(samples)) = 138.96

h) Visualizing the plot of the signal, we can search for periods of time with unusually high
amounts of traffic. It should be verified that these outliers occur annually; since we have
2 years worth of measurements, the outliers found in the samples of the first half should 
appear after roughly 12 months in the second half. This is mandatory, in order to exclude
irregular events.

Given that the remaining periods associated with heavy traffic can be correlated with 
specific annual events with known dates, and that the periods in between these special
events match in duration with the periods in between the outliers, we may confidently
pin each outlier to a known specific annual event. Afterwards, finding the date on which
the measurements began is just a matter of subtracting the amount of time that passed
from the first sample to the sample mapped to an annual event, from the date of that
annual event.

Of course, because we rely on yearly events, this method is culture specific, in the
sense that we might mistake Christmas for Laylat al-Qadr, which are both extremely
important occasions on which heavy traffic is experienced, but which occur on very
different dates.

Another problem is accuracy. It is highly likely that the periods with heavy traffic
will be longer in duration than the specific dates they are correlated with, which
means that a precise date might be difficult to map to the spikes in traffic (Heavy
traffic may be registered not only on Christmas day, but also 2-3 days around that
date).

It is also possible that these measurements took place when some major event overlapped
with an annual one (a pandemic, for example), which would reduce the traffic spikes which
would be expected around that time of the year. This would prove very difficult to tell
from the irregular events.
